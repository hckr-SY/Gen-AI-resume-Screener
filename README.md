## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the GenAI Resume Screener on your machine:

---

### 1. ðŸ“¥ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hckr-SY/Gen-AI-resume-Screener.git
cd Gen-AI-resume-Screener
---

### ðŸ“¦ 2. Install Dependencies
### Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
---


# ðŸ¤– 3. Start Ollama & Pull Model
# Make sure Ollama is installed and running locally.

# Pull the required model (e.g., mistral):

```bash
ollama pull mistral
---

# ðŸ§  4. Preprocess Job Descriptions (Optional)
# Parse and cache all job descriptions from job_description.csv:

```bash
python precompute_jds.py
---

# ðŸ“„ 5. Preprocess Resumes 
# Parse all resumes in data/allCV/ and insert them into the database:

```bash
python precompute_cvs.py
---

# ðŸš€ 6. Launch the Streamlit Web App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
